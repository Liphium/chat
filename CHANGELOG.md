# Currently in dev

- Fixed the shortcut being deleted and re-created when installing a new version causing it to unpinned from the taskbar/start menu (Windows auto updater)
- Added an account management page that talks to the new endpoints for search, deleting and changing the ranks of accounts
- Changed the app icon to better work with white mode on Windows (color still isn't good, but it looks a little better)
