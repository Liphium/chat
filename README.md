# Liphium: Decentralization for everyone

Welcome to the repository of the app used to interact with [station](https://github.com/Liphium/station), our decentralized backend service. With this app you can share files of any size, chat with anyone who has a "town" (what we call our servers) and even go into Spaces with them where you can play card games, share Minecraft servers or just talk with them. This is probably the quickest introduction I've ever given about the app and if you want to know more: [Our website exists](https://liphium.com).

You can find a lot of information about the app [in the help & resources page](https://liphium.com/docs). If you want to know what's next for Liphium, check out [the roadmap](https://liphium.dev/roadmap). If your question isn't answered, you can always join the [Discord](https://liphium.dev/discord) or send an E-Mail (both available on our website).

## Download

You can always find up-to-date information about where Liphium is available on [the downloads page](https://liphium.com/docs/general/download/). At the time of writing this Liphium is only available on Windows through the Microsoft Store. We're working on expanding to more platforms, but there's only so much one fellow can do. If you want to help pushing out Liphium to more platforms, join the Discord and contact any developer on there. We'd really appreciate the help. 

## The goal

With Liphium, the attempt is to hide all of the decentralization magic and give the user a completely normal experience like on any other platform that is as good, if not better, than the other product. I don't want to make *another* open-source end-to-end encrypted messenger that brags about how privacy-focused it is. All of that should be obvious. I want to build something people *actually* want to use because of what it is and not just because of privacy promises or the promise of digital freedom. I want to show the world how you can build a really cool and useful platform on top of both end-to-end encrypted and privacy-focused backend while not even mentioning it to the normal if they don't want to hear about it. None of this has been achieved, but I've been building it for the last 2 years and know that it *can* be achieved. That's why I'm still working on this project after such a long time.

## This repository

This repository contains all of the code available for Liphium's client app.

## Contributing

I appreciate that you want to contribute, the problem is just that there are no guides on how to navigate this gigantic codebase and before I sent you down this big rabbit hole I want to actually provide decent information on where things are and how things work. If you just want to help fix some typos, feel free to create a pull request. If you have a feature you want to request or have a bug that's bothering you, open an issue. If you want to help ship Liphium to more platforms, either open an issue or join the Discord server and contact me through there. Once guides and more are available I'll also make an announcement somewhere.
