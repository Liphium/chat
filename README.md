# chat_interface

I'm making a chat app or something, this is a really big project. Even with voice chat and such and it's kinda something I wanted to create for a very long time. So now we're here. Yeah, this will hopefully be cool.

## Installation
For now, the app only works on Windows (macOS and Linux support coming soon!). Here are some steps on how to set up the Alpha release on Windows and Linux:
1. Download the latest release, unzip it and run it once. It should automatically download the current version and keep it in a safe place. It also creates a Desktop shortcut, so you can access Liphium again.
2. Click the shortcut on your Desktop and launch the app, now you'll need a server that actually runs the station. There is currently no way of setting it up, so if you're not one of my friends, I'm sorry.
