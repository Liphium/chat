# Liphium Chat

Liphium Chat is a novel approach to the design and feature set of a chat app. While it looks very similar and functions very similar to all other chat apps on the market right now, there are a lot of useful additions and little tweaks that help you out every day. 

**Have 5 GB of footage you need to send to one of your friends?** No problem, you can stream files straight to your friends with Zap Share (like AirDrop or Quick Share over the internet). 

**Want to play any kinds of board games online?** With Tabletop you can play any kind of card or board game online, right inside of the app.

**Want to share a call with all of your friends?** Put it into your status and everyone in your friends list can see and join it, without ever navigating to your conversation, all right within the sidebar.

Liphium Chat is not a new kind of chat app. It's just what all other chat apps have always been missing. And the new ideas for features don't stop here, Liphium is only in it's Alpha after all. You can also learn more about the app on the [website](https://liphium.com).

## This repository

With all that said, this repository contains the main app for Liphium. It's one codebase for both mobile and desktop platforms making use of the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework for at least somewhat seamless experiences across platforms. I know that there are still things wrong with the app, especially on Desktop, but I hope I'll get to at least somewhat fixing that over the Alpha period.

## Installation

For now, the app only works on Windows. There is a release build with a zip archive and a .exe file right inside of it that you can click to install. The thing is though: For actually using the app, you need a server that runs [station](https://github.com/Liphium/station) (the backend of Liphium). Since the app is self-hosted and there is no guide for setting up a server yet, you'll have to wait some time until all of that gets in place. It'll probably be available on the website when it's actually ready.
